# Shapeshift Demo Application
This app is a demonstration of my experience with React/Redux paired with Udi Dahan SOA
(Service Oriented Architecture) based "microservices." The application was split into different
services based upon functionality. The first service, shapeshift-exchange-management-api, is  responsible for storing and updated data on the current prices of each of the cryptocurrencies at
each exchange. It does this by publishing a RabbitMQ command message to itself on a delay queue (only one second delay on first startup and then every minute). It publishes a different message for each of the exchange that it has stored in it's database. This ensures that if one of the external APIs is down it does not affect the others. Once it updates the current prices, it publishes a RabbitMQ exchangeUpdated Event message in a fanout pattern.

One of the services that subscribes to this message is the shapeshift-exchange-ranking-cqrs service. This service acts as a CQRS datastore that massages the exchangeUpdated event messages to store the exchange with the best rate for each cryptocurrency.

`Disclaimer #1: This is a somewhat contrived example of SOA requirements, such a small app would never need a CQRS store or distinct service boundaries of any kind. That being said, it is a read-only store that separates the need for server based calculations in the shapeshift-exchange-management-api when requesting lowest rates. This could lead to easy extensibility in the form of say, emails when a price reaches a low point at any of the services.`

The other service that subscribes to the exchangeUpdated message is the shapeshift-historical-pricing-api service. This service acts as a datastore for all historical data separate from receiving only exchange current pricing.

`Disclaimer #2: This is another contrived example of SOA requirements, such a small app would never need this kind of data distinction unless you let it update continually for an extended period of time. That being said, it is a read-only store that separates the historical data for the sake of the frontend application. If left to update every minute for an extended period of time, requesting all of this historical data with the current exchange rate data would quickly overload the frontend application. Separating the data out allows easier access to analytics, the ability to perhaps different, more efficiently, store the data, and safer management.`

I used a template to get React/Redux with Webpack running quickly and then simply added the necessary pieces (actions, actionCreators, reducers, components, sagas, api calls) to get each of the three services - Exchanges, Rates, and Historical Pricing - displayed in different components on the home page.
